        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>These dirty soda cookies combine devil's food cake mix with Dr. Pepper
        for the easiest cookie dough ever, then a 3-ingredient glaze is drizzled over the top.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) box devil's food cake mix</li>
            <li>6 fluid ounces Dr. Pepper soda or cola</li>
            <li>Cooking Spray</li>
            <li>2 cups confectioner's sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coconut milk or coconut coffee creamer</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon lime zest</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Stir cake mix and soda together in a bowl until a dough forms (dough will be sticky). Coat hands lightly with cooking spray and roll tablespoon-sized balls of dough. Place dough balls on the prepared baking sheet and press lightly to slightly flatten the tops.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are just baked around the edges and still soft in the center, 8 to 9 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack set over parchment paper or set inside a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Whisk confectioner's sugar, coconut milk, lime zest, and salt together in a bowl until smooth. Drizzle icing over cookies and let stand until icing firms up slightly.</li>
        </ol>
