        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>"This delicate Bavarian cream pie features a homemade eggnog 
            that can be made in the microwave or on the stovetop.
            A graham cracker crust may be substituted for pre-baked pie crust.
            Creating this pie is a bit to do, but well worth the time spent!"</p>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin</li>
                <li>1/4 cup cold water</li>
                <li>1 cup milk</li>
                <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>1/4 cup rum</li>
                <li>1 cup whipping cream</li>
                <li>1/4 pinch white sugar</li>
                <li>1 (9 inch) pie shell, baked</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine gelatin and cold water; set aside to soften. Combine milk and 1/2 cup sugar in a small glass bowl. Microwave for 3 minutes or until milk begins to boil.</li>
                <li>In a steady stream, pour hot milk into beaten eggs, whisking constantly. Cook custard in the microwave, whisking after each minute, until it thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Stir in softened gelatin and mix until melted. Stir in rum.</li>
                <li>Let filling cool to room temperature. (If you refrigerate it, stir occasionally to prevent gelatin from setting too soon.)</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whip cream until soft peaks form; beat in 1/4 cup sugar.</li>
                <li>Set aside 1/2 cup of whipped cream for garnish; keep refrigerated. Fold remaining whipped cream into eggnog mixture. Pour filling into pie crust and refrigerate 4 hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>Garnish with reserved whipped cream and a dusting of nutmeg.</li>
            </ol>
